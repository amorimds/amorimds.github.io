I'm a 20 years old Data Science Intern, I live in Brazil and I work in an Insurtech company. I love Data Science. The thing I like the most in this area is the constant learning experience and the very wide applicability.
My first contact with this area was at college in my economics graduation, when I study Econometrics and Economic statistics. It was love at first sight, since then I start studying Data Science and Machine Learning by my self while I was graduating in economics.
Later I decided to do another graduation but this time in Data Science, that helped me a lot with some deep concepts about Machine Learning and Data Mining as well as the Math behind it.
While I was graduating in Data Science, I start applying for data science positions and got a job at Youse, where I could learn a lot about real-life Data Science and Machine Learning.
